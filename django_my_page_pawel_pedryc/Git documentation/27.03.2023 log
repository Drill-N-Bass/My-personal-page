Updated things 24.03.2023:

I moved Django page to AWS ElasticBeanstalk. All static files are in AWS S3 now.
Additionally, `Skpy` client works. It's a client needed for sending comments from users directly to my Skype.

Because I didn't create some sort of secure system related to Skype login mechanism, at this point I won't commit views.py.

Besides the fact that all works, this version is dirty. There is a need to update some CSS and create similar page for mobile/smartphone

28.03.2023: added environment variables in views.py for `skpy` (skype client)
