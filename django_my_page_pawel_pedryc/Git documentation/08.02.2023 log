Git 08.02.2023 log

Last few days I was updating a lot of stuff on my page.

I finally finished the main mechanism of my comment form. 
I also added a feature to save essays for later (maybe it was partially made in the past)
I also almost finished all things mentioned above for all platforms: pc, tablet, and smartphone.

I did a lot of changes in css related to the topics mentioned above. 

Some views were updated too from function-view to class-based views.

I added my email as a new model and use it in the footer.
