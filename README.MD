The Git-related info:
Since the creation of my website took a long time - which was related to deepening my knowledge of JS, Django, and creating a website for Apiarena - commits for early versions of this project are fragmented in several repositories. For this reason the "easter egg" associated with my site is built in the 'Gallows-Hangman-game' repository. However, the skeleton of an early version of my Django website is located as a project branch with the `Apiarena` repository (which is also a complete repository for the` Apiarena` website, another commercial project I have done).

This confusion was the result of the transition from using the GIT Bash terminal to the implemented Git commit system in Visual Studio Code. However, I must admit that I was aware of the problems I entered before they happened. All these circumstances were intentional, because I wanted to check a few things thanks to them that would give me additional valuable programming knowledge.

- First, I wanted to see how well Visual Studio Code is doing with Git.
- I wanted to know how difficult it is to separate repositories (using Visual Studio Code)
- I also wanted to see how difficult it is to split the Django project into two projects (because initially, both my website and the Apiarena project were actually one project: they had one common `settings.py`, but different` models, py` and ` views.py` and `url.py`)

Due to the fact that the `Apiarena` project was not implemented in a large team, and the entire aspect related to Django was only my participation, I could allow myself to take the first steps in building the` Apiarena` website a test site for the issues raised above.

The next stages of work on my personal page and on the `Apiarena` project have already been carried out in accordance with the methodology of working with GIT repositories.
